## CSS best practices

- **Consistent Methodology**: Apply and stick to the project's consistent CSS methodology (Tailwind, BEM, utility classes, CSS modules, etc.) across the entire project
- **Avoid Overriding Framework Styles**: Work with your framework's patterns rather than fighting against them with excessive overrides
- **Maintain Design System**: Establish and document design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) for consistency
- **Minimize Custom CSS**: Leverage framework utilities and components to reduce custom CSS maintenance burden
- **Performance Considerations**: Optimize for production with CSS purging/tree-shaking to remove unused styles
- **Dashboard Consistency**: Organize and document any dashboard-specific styles to ensure that all phases of the project UI remain visually consistent and easy to update. Use shared utility classes and design tokens to keep the styling unified across all views.
