# Multi-Day Events Implementation - Complete Guide

## 🎉 Overview

Your calendar has been successfully updated to display multi-day events across all the days they span. Events now appear as continuous horizontal bars stretching from the start date through the end date, making it easy to visualize project durations and overlapping schedules.

## 📁 Documentation Files

This implementation includes several documentation files:

1. **MULTI_DAY_EVENTS_README.md** (this file) - Main overview and quick start
2. **MULTI_DAY_EVENTS_SUMMARY.md** - Implementation summary and key changes
3. **MULTI_DAY_EVENTS_GUIDE.md** - Detailed guide with testing instructions
4. **BEFORE_AFTER_COMPARISON.md** - Visual before/after comparisons
5. **scripts/add-test-multiday-events.js** - Test script with sample events

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Test the Implementation

**Method 1: Interactive** (Recommended)
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then:
1. Open your browser to the calendar
2. Click and drag across multiple days (e.g., Monday to Thursday)
3. Fill in event details
4. Click "Save"
5. Watch the event span all selected days! ✨

**Method 2: View Test Data**
```bash
node scripts/add-test-multiday-events.js
```
This outputs sample multi-day events you can use for testing.

## ✅ What Changed

### Code Changes
- **src/components/Calendar.tsx** (Lines 168-302)
  - Updated event selection handler
  - Added multi-day event validation in save logic
  - Edge case handling for same-day events

### Existing CSS (No changes needed)
- **src/styles/calendar.css** already has proper styling for multi-day events

## 🎯 Key Concept: Exclusive End Dates

FullCalendar uses **exclusive end dates**:

```typescript
// To display an event on Oct 15, 16, and 17 (3 days):
{
  start: '2025-10-15',  // First day
  end: '2025-10-18',    // Day AFTER last day (exclusive)
  allDay: true
}
```

Think of it as: `[start, end)` — includes start, excludes end.

## 📊 Visual Result

### Before
```
Mon  Tue  Wed  Thu  Fri
[3-D] ─── ─── ─── ───   ❌ Event only on Monday
```

### After
```
Mon  Tue  Wed  Thu  Fri
[────3-Day Event────]   ✅ Event spans Mon-Wed
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create multi-day event by clicking and dragging
- [ ] Verify event spans all selected days
- [ ] Edit existing event to change duration
- [ ] Drag event to different dates (preserves duration)
- [ ] Resize event by dragging edges
- [ ] Create event that crosses week boundary
- [ ] Check that events maintain color coding
- [ ] Verify location pin icon appears

## 💡 Usage Examples

### 2-Day Project
```typescript
{
  title: 'Fence Installation',
  start: '2025-10-15',
  end: '2025-10-17',     // Shows on 15th & 16th
  allDay: true,
  className: 'evt-fence'
}
```

### Week-Long Project
```typescript
{
  title: 'Guardrail Installation',
  start: '2025-10-27',   // Monday
  end: '2025-11-03',     // Next Monday (shows Mon-Sun)
  allDay: true,
  className: 'evt-guardrail'
}
```

### Two-Week Project
```typescript
{
  title: 'Site Renovation',
  start: '2025-11-10',
  end: '2025-11-24',     // 14 days
  allDay: true,
  className: 'evt-temp-fence'
}
```

## 🎨 Event Types & Colors

Your calendar supports 5 event types with distinct colors:

| Type | Color | CSS Class |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Fence | Orange | `evt-fence` |
| Guardrail | Green | `evt-guardrail` |
| Attenuator | Red | `evt-attenuator` |
| Temp Fence | Yellow | `evt-temp-fence` |
| Handrail | Blue | `evt-handrail` |

All colors work perfectly with multi-day event spanning.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Event Object Structure
```typescript
{
  id: string;                    // Unique identifier
  title: string;                 // Event title
  start: string;                 // ISO date: '2025-10-15'
  end: string;                   // ISO date (exclusive): '2025-10-18'
  allDay: boolean;               // true for multi-day events
  className: string;             // CSS class for styling
  extendedProps: {
    type: string;                // Event type
    location?: string;           // Optional location
    description?: string;        // Optional description
  }
}
```

### Date Format
- Use ISO 8601 date format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Example: `'2025-10-15'`
- Time not needed for all-day events

### Validation Logic
The code automatically handles:
- Same-day events (adds 1 day to end)
- End before start (adjusts to valid range)
- Invalid date formats (falls back to safe defaults)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Event Only Shows on First Day
**Problem**: Event appears only on start date  
**Solution**: Verify `end` date is AFTER `start` date (remember: exclusive end)

```typescript
// ❌ Wrong
{ start: '2025-10-15', end: '2025-10-15' }

// ✅ Correct (shows on 15th only)
{ start: '2025-10-15', end: '2025-10-16' }

// ✅ Correct (shows on 15th, 16th, 17th)
{ start: '2025-10-15', end: '2025-10-18' }
```

### Event Ends One Day Early
**Problem**: 3-day event only shows 2 days  
**Solution**: Remember end date is exclusive, add 1 day

```typescript
// To show Oct 15, 16, 17 (3 days):
{ start: '2025-10-15', end: '2025-10-18' }  // ✅
// NOT
{ start: '2025-10-15', end: '2025-10-17' }  // ❌ Shows only 2 days
```

### Event Doesn't Span Full Width
**Problem**: Event appears as single-day block  
**Solution**: Ensure `allDay: true`

```typescript
{
  start: '2025-10-15',
  end: '2025-10-18',
  allDay: true  // ✅ Required for multi-day spanning
}
```

## 🎓 How Multi-Day Events Work

### 1. User Creates Event
- User clicks and drags across days (e.g., Mon to Thu)
- FullCalendar triggers `handleSelect` with date range
- Date range includes exclusive end date (Friday in this case)

### 2. Event Dialog Opens
- User enters title, type, location, description
- Start and end dates pre-filled from selection
- User can manually adjust dates if needed

### 3. Event Validation
- Code checks if end > start
- If same day or invalid, adds 1 day to end
- Prevents creating invalid date ranges

### 4. Event Rendering
- FullCalendar renders event across all days
- Event spans from start (inclusive) to end (exclusive)
- CSS ensures proper styling and width

### 5. Event Interaction
- Click: Opens edit dialog
- Drag: Moves event (preserves duration)
- Resize: Changes event duration
