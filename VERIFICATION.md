# Verification Plan (UI Consistency)

This file will track screenshots, a11y checks, and CI guards once we apply the design tokens and primitives across the app.

To be completed after migration:
- Screenshot grid (light/dark × comfortable/compact) for:
  - Home, Calendar, Event Modal, Customers, Employees, Reports
- Axe a11y summaries (no critical issues)
- Checklist mapping TARGET BASELINE → changed files
- CI Checks
  - Lint rule/script to block raw hex/rgb and disallowed classes
  - Guard to ensure only one icon set
- Unit tests
  - Button/Input states and token usage
- Visual snapshots
  - Header, Button variants, Input, Table row, Event chip
