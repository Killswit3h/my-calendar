## Commenting conventions (my-calendar)

### What to comment

- **Module/class headers**: Use short JSDoc blocks on controllers/services/repositories describing what they handle (keeps the code skimmable).
- **Public handlers**: For controller handler methods, document:
  - supported routes (`/api/<resource>` vs `/api/<resource>/[id]`)
  - supported query params (filters like `?name=`, flags like `?expanded=true`)
  - any non-obvious parsing/normalization
- **Tricky logic only**: Add inline comments for “why” (not “what”) when the code is subtle (e.g. normalization, coercion rules, uniqueness checks, relation connect/disconnect behavior).

### What not to comment

- **No commented-out code**: delete it (use git history).
- **No “recent fix” narration**: avoid comments like “TEMP”, “HACK”, “fixed bug”, etc.
- **Don’t restate types**: if TypeScript makes intent clear, skip the comment.

### Comment tone + style

- Prefer concise, factual phrasing and stable language that won’t rot.
- If you need a list, keep it short and scoped to the function/class it documents.

### Spec alignment

- Prefer comments that make it easy to connect code back to the spec:
  - “Supports: GET /api/<resource> with ?foo= filter”
  - “Defaults: is_payroll/is_EEO/status handled in service beforeCreate”
- Avoid copying the spec verbatim into comments—capture only the bits that help a future reader understand the contract.
